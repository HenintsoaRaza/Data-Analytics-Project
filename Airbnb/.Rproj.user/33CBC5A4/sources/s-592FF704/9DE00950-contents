```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Data Preprocessing

For the preprocessing, we use the preprocessing script. We run this script with source().

```{r}
source("data_preparation_script.R", local = knitr::knit_global())

```


```{r listings}
head(listings)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
